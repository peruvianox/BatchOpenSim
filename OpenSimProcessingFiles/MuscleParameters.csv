"Table 1.ÿMuscle model parameters. Maximum isometric force (Fo) were recalculated fromÿArnold et al. (2010)ÿassuming specific tension of 40ÿN/cm2, such that the leg was 45% muscle by mass, which is an average value for healthy women (Shih et al., 2000). Values for the fast-twitch fiber proportion (FT) were scaled up by 10% from cadaver data (Johnson et al., 1973) to account for the loss of fast-twitch motor units with aging. Values for neutral muscle lengths (a0) andÿCCÿforce?length parabola width (W) were set so that the combination ofÿCCÿoptimal length (Lo) and SEC unloaded length (Lu) caused muscles to produce maximum isometric forces and drop off their force?length curves at the same joint angles identified inÿdynamometerÿexperiments (Anderson et al., 2007). Moment arm lengths to theÿjoint rotationÿcenters (ri) were referenced fromÿMenegaldo et al. (2004). The subscripts indicate: 1/2/3=hip flexion/adduction/internal rotation; 4=knee extension; 5/6=ankle dorsiflexion/eversion; 7=toe extension; 15/16/17=trunk extension/lateral bending/rotation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
